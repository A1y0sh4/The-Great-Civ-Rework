# The Great Civ Rework
It's an ambitious project that aims to modifiy the game, without removing the vanilla feeling. It includes: civs, buildings and policies, and offers the player new original mechanics to play with.
So far I improved every civ in the game and changed most policies and buildings.



# How to install it
This mod counts as a rulesets. This means that It completly replaces the vanilla code and, as such a type of mod, it can be applied to the base game in the game-creator screen not among the Extension mods, but in the Base Ruleset section
